Could have different systems with different capabilities that could be used in a plug and play fassion. I think making a pathfinder character creator is a great idea, but that already exists. I wonder if integrating with the JSON they output is viable. 

I learnend that the PF2e content is available via the ORC license to do most anything Iw ant with which is awesome. I want to learn technology through this passion. Right now I want to create characters and then render them and display them throughout the simple app I'm working on. Creating primitives and components in this process is very improtant. 

Example: given a statblock, render it.
