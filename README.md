## Goals
Create an encounter creator to help Pathfinder `GMs` instantiate combat.

## Constraints
- Only use _small_ subset of monsters
- Support simple _small_ room layout with one layer
- Use HTMX even when it does not make sense
  - _note: point is to see the interaction and to use the beam WITH another technology_
- ... There is maybe more to add here ...
