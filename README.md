# Whimsy

AI Powered GM tools

## Goals
Create an encounter creator to help Pathfinder `GMs` instantiate combat.

## Constraints
- Only use _small_ subset of monsters
- Support simple _small_ room layout with one layer
- Use HTMX even when it does not make sense
  - _note: point is to see the interaction and to use the beam WITH another technology_
- ... There is maybe more to add here ...

## Early Days (log)
Jan 25 

I know have a very simple page rendering using htmx at /app. I need to think more about the various components necessary to flesh this application out. 

Things like a _grid_ and pathfinder specific _tools_ and integrating with a set of monsters and such. 

I would like to continue to use HTMX in order to add reactivity to the page every where that it makes sense!
