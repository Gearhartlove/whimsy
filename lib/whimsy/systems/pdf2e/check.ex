  @moduledoc """
  Usually made by rolling a single 20-sided dice (a d20) and adding a number based on the relevant attribute. Rolling high is generally a better outcome.

  Each check has a DC or 'Difficulty Check'.
  If the result is equal to or greater than the DC, the check is successful. If it's less, it's a failure.
  A PC can a achieve a 'critical success' or 'critical failure' by roaling 10 higher or 10 lower, respectively.
